# Conclusion
## Challenges
- Data related issues
  - Availability of datasets
    - Amount of data must be sufficiently large and realistic
    - The data should comprehend various types of attacks
  - Quality of data
    - Most proposed methods use high quality of data [195]
    - In real systems data is very noisy
    - Algorithms must learn to generalise and cope with noisy data [198, 259]
- Lieflong training
  - Models have to be repeatedly trained with new data and recent patterns
  - Models should adapt well to new environments 
- Privacy
  - ML/DL algorithms can leak data
- Computional complexity
- Implementation on edge
