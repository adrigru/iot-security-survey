# What is IoT?
- Groups of heterogeneous physical devices running software, often equipped with sensors that exchange data with other devices over the Internet or other communication networks.
- The networking and computing capacities are limited due to size, space and energy consumption constraints
- It facilitates automation based on recognising events from the near surroundings
- There are countless use-cases for using IoT in various domains ranging from consumer electronics to smart cities or smart healthcare
## Current state
- Meanwhile, interdisciplinary area of research including numerous fields such as Machine Learning, Embedded Systems, Networking and Distributed Systems.
- Wide adoption, the automation does not require human intervention
- Devices control environment and take decisions
- There is a significant number of different standards and technologies adapted within the network
- Critics emphasise security and privacy concerns as the main weak spot of IoT
## Future
- The number of connected devices is estimated to increase greatly in the upcoming years
- The platform fragmentation is expected to increase
- Making devices intelligent by integrating machine learning so they learn and adapt to fit individual human needs
- Increased decentralisation and complexity
- Emergence of new application layer Web of Things opening a market for modern services
## Relevance
- The devices are very close to humans and can affect our well-being and safety
- A variety of critical systems and infrastructure depends on these devices
- The great interest and predicted future adoption make IoT an active area of research that attracts researchers from outside of computer science and electrical engineering for instance social sciences or environmental studies
- The sheer number of connected devices poses a security threat and a vector potential for misuses  
# What is DDoS?
## Brief explanation
- The propagation of insecure iot devices provides a fertile ground for malicious actors and has resulted in an increased number of botnet attacks on the internet infrastructure
- The infected systems allow attackers to control remote devices
- Botnets are an ideal tool for performing a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS).
- DDoS attacks temporarily limit or disrupt availability of an online service by overloading the target with an excess amount of requests.
- The damage is mostly inflicted in terms of money, reputation and time
## Mirai botnet example
- Mirai is a botnet consisting of hundreds of thousands of devices
- Investigation shows that Mirai primarily infects devices such as CCTV cameras, digital video recorders and routers
- The infected devices scan public internet for other IoT devices and tries to gain access by brute-forcing username-password pairs
- In 2016 MIRAI botnet performed a large scale attack on public DNS infrastructure peaking at 1Tbps
# Machine learning
## Bit of background
- Powerful methods for detecting and patterns in data
- Generally used for classification tasks but modern applications include translation, speech recognition and computer vision.
- In the field of cyber-security proven useful in fraud, malware and spam detection systems
## Current developments
- Active area of research that is consistently growing 
- Deep learning approaches opened possibilities for novel use-cases
- Deep reinforcement learning algorithm AlphaGo beats human performance and proves the abilities of strategical reasoning and decision making
## How does it come to play here
- Detection of anomalies in real-time network traffic based on pattern recognition
- Intrusion detection on IoT devices
- Prediction of future attacks based on historic data
## Challenges for ML on IoT
- Variety of scenarios
- Extensive variety of devices and fragmented platform
- Complex architecture setting
- Limited resources on edge
# Aim of the study
- Survey Machine Learning techniques for DDoS detection
